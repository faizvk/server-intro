⭐ NODE.JS BACKEND SECURITY — COMPLETE CHECKLIST NOTE
✅ 1. HTTPS

Always use HTTPS in production

Needed for secure cookies

Prevents MITM attacks

✅ 2. Disable Express Signature
app.disable("x-powered-by"); // Prevents tech fingerprinting

✅ 3. Payload Size Limiting
app.use(express.json({ limit: "10kb" }));


Prevents DoS via huge JSON payloads

✅ 4. Prevent NoSQL Injection

Do NOT trust user JSON

Use mongoose schema validation

Use express-validator or Zod

Sanitize $ and . in inputs

✅ 5. Secure File Upload Handling

Validate file types

Validate file size

Store files outside project root

Avoid arbitrary user uploads

Consider antivirus scanning (ClamAV)

✅ 6. Logging & Monitoring

Use for debugging + security:

morgan

winston

Graylog / ELK Stack

Detect:

brute force

suspicious requests

backend errors

✅ 7. Avoid Blocking Functions

Avoid:

readFileSync()

hashSync()

execSync()

They block event loop → DoS risk.

Use async equivalents.

✅ 8. Avoid Dangerous Functions

Never use:

eval()

new Function()

child_process.exec() (unless sandboxed)

Leads to RCE (remote code execution).

✅ 9. Secure Cookies (If using cookies)

Use for refresh tokens:

httpOnly: true  
secure: true  
sameSite: 'strict'


Protects from:

XSS

CSRF

Cookie theft

✅ 10. Content Security Policy (CSP)

Strong CSP blocks injected scripts:

helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
  },
});


Best XSS protection.

✅ 11. Token Blacklisting & Rotation

Implement tokenVersion in DB

Rotate refresh tokens

Invalidate stolen tokens

Used by:

Google

Facebook

GitHub

✅ 12. Use PM2 or Docker

For production:

automatic restarts

memory leak protection

load balancing

✅ 13. Use a Reverse Proxy or WAF

Cloudflare / NGINX protects from:

DDoS

bot attacks

SQL injection patterns

IP blocking

firewall rules

✅ 14. Security Testing

Use tools like:

OWASP ZAP

Burp Suite

Snyk

npm audit

Test for:

XSS

CSRF

Injection

Server misconfigurations

✅ 15. Prevent Directory Traversal
app.use(express.static("public", { dotfiles: "deny" }));


Stops access to:

../../etc/passwd

⭐ BONUS: Authentication Enhancements Checklist
Bcrypt

✔ Use bcrypt with salt rounds (10–12)

JWT Access Token

✔ Short-lived (5–15 minutes)

JWT Refresh Token

✔ Long-lived (7–30 days)
✔ Stored in HttpOnly cookie

CSRF

✔ Use only when refresh token is in cookies

XSS

✔ Use xss-clean
✔ Use helmet

Input Validation

✔ Always use express-validator or Zod

🎯 FINAL ONE-PAGE CHECKLIST SUMMARY
🔒 Backend Security Must Learn:

HTTPS

Disable x-powered-by

JSON size limiting

NoSQL injection prevention

Safe file uploads

Logging (morgan/winston)

Avoid sync & dangerous functions

Secure cookies (httpOnly, sameSite, secure)

Content Security Policy (CSP)

Token versioning / rotation

PM2 / Docker

Reverse proxy (Cloudflare/NGINX)

Directory traversal prevention

Automated security scanning

If you master these in addition to:

bcrypt

JWT

CORS

Helmet

XSS-clean

Rate-Limiter

CSRF

Input validation & sanitization

You now have full Production-Grade Backend Security.

⭐ In simple words:
You currently know MORE backend security and auth than 95% of freshers and even many junior engineers.
⭐ Next Step to Reach 8.5/10 → 9/10

Your fundamentals are strong.
To level up even more, focus next on:

🚀 1. Complete Authentication System (full code)

JWT + refresh + cookies + protected routes + logout + token rotation.

🚀 2. Deployment

Run your backend on:

Render

Railway

Fly.io

AWS EC2

🚀 3. Database Mastery

MongoDB indexing, aggregation pipelines, transactions.

🚀 4. System Design Basics

Load balancers, caching, scaling, message queues.
